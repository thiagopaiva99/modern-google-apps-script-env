## What led me to develop this?
Google Apps Script is a very good and useful technology, but with features that are not very good when developing applications with it.

### We have some disadvantages whe using it.
- The online editor;
- Old version of JavaScript;
- Hard to do tests and use plugins;

And of course, these items mentioned above have sub-items.

I like to quote these items because I suffered a lot with them when I had to use Google Apps Script.
